A.
Severerecurrenttemperoutburstsmanifestedverbally (e.g., verbal rages) and/or behaviorally (e.g., physical aggression towardpeople or property) that are grossly out of proportion in intensity or duration to the situation or provocation.

B.
The temper outbursts are inconsistent with developmental level.

C.
Thetemperoutburstsoccur, onaverage, threeormoretimesperweek.

D.
The mood between temper outbursts is persistently irritable orangry most of the day, nearly every day, and is observable by others (e.g., parents, teachers, peers).

E.
Criteria A–Dhavebeenpresentfor 12 ormoremonths.Throughoutthattime, theindividualhasnothadaperiodlasting 3 ormoreconsecutive months without all of the symptoms in Criteria A–D.

F.

G.
The diagnosis should not be made for the first time before age 6 years or after age 18 years.

H.
By history or observation, the age at onset of Criteria A–E is before 10 years.

I.
There has never been a distinct period lasting more than 1 dayduring which the full symptom criteria, except duration, for a manic or hypomanic episode have been met.

Note: Developmentally appropriate mood elevation, such as occurs in the context of a highly positive event or its anticipation, should not be considered as a symptom of mania or hypomania.

J.
Thebehaviorsdonotoccurexclusivelyduringanepisodeofmajor depressive disorder and are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., autism spectrum disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, separation anxiety disorder, persistent depressive disorder [dysthymia]).

Note: Thisdiagnosiscannotcoexistwithoppositionaldefiantdisorder, intermittent explosive disorder, or bipolardisorder, though it can coexist with others, including major depressive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and substance use disorders. Individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for both disruptivemooddysregulationdisorderand oppositional defiant disorder should only be given the diagnosis of disruptive mooddysregulationdisorder.Ifanindividualhaseverexperienced amanicorhypomanicepisode, the diagnosisof disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should not be assigned.

K.
The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects ofa substance or to another medical or neurological condition.

Major Depressive Disorder

A.
Five (ormore)ofthefollowingsymptomshavebeenpresentduringthesame 2-weekperiodandrepresentachangefrompreviousfunctioning; at least one of the symptoms is either (1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure.

Note: Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributable to another medical condition.
1. Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, hopeless)orobservationmadebyothers (e.g., appearstearful). (

Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood.)
2. Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation).
3. Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., achangeofmorethan 5%ofbodyweightinamonth), ordecrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. (

Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain.)
4. Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day.
5. Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).

6. Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day.

7. Feelingsofworthlessnessorexcessiveorinappropriateguilt (which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely selfreproach or guilt about being sick).
8. Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed by others).
9. Recurrentthoughtsofdeath (notjustfearofdying), recurrentsuicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.

B.
The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairmentin social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

C.
The episode is not attributable to the physiological effects of asubstance or to another medical condition.

Note: Criteria A–C represent a major depressive episode.

Note: Responsestoasignificantloss (e.g., bereavement, financialruin, losses from a natural disaster, a serious medical illness or disability)mayincludethefeelingsofintensesadness, ruminationaboutthe loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss noted in Criterion A, whichmayresembleadepressiveepisode.Althoughsuchsymptoms may be understandable or considered appropriate to the loss, the presence of a major depressive episode in addition to the normal response to a significant loss should also be carefully considered. This decisioninevitablyrequirestheexerciseofclinicaljudgmentbasedon the individual’s history and the cultural norms for the expression of distress in the context of loss.1

Coding and

Recording Procedures
The diagnostic code for major depressive disorder is based on whether this is a single or recurrent episode, current severity, presence of psychotic features, and remission status. Current severity and psychotic features are only indicated if full criteria are currently metforamajordepressiveepisode.Remissionspecifiersareonlyindicated if the full criteria are not currently met for a major depressive episode. Codes are as follows:

Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)
300.4 (F 

34. 1)
This disorder represents a consolidation of DSM-IV-defined chronic major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder.

A.
Depressed mood for most of the day, for more days than not, asindicated by either subjective account or observation by others, for at least 2 years.

Note: Inchildrenandadolescents, moodcanbeirritableandduration must be at least 1 year.

B.
Presence, while depressed, of two (or more) of the following: 

1. Poor appetite or overeating.

2. Insomnia or hypersomnia.

3. Low energy or fatigue.

4. Low self-esteem.

5. Poor concentration or difficulty making decisions.

6. Feelings of hopelessness.

C.
During the 2-year period (1 year for children or adolescents) ofthedisturbance, theindividualhasneverbeenwithoutthesymptoms in Criteria A and B for more than 2 months at a time.

D.
Criteriaforamajordepressivedisordermaybecontinuouslypresent for 2 years.

E.
Therehasneverbeen amanicepisodeorahypomanicepisode, and criteria have never been met for cyclothymic disorder.

F.
The disturbance is not better explained by a persistent schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, delusional disorder, or otherspecified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder.

G.
The symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects ofa substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hypothyroidism).

H.
The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairmentin social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

Note: Because the criteria for a major depressive episode include four symptoms that are absent from the symptom list for persistent depressivedisorder (dysthymia), averylimitednumberofindividuals willhavedepressivesymptomsthathavepersistedlongerthan 2 years but will not meet criteria for persistent depressive disorder. If full criteria for a major depressive episode have been met at some point during the current episode of illness, they should be given a diagnosis of major depressive disorder. Otherwise, a diagnosis of other specified depressive disorder or unspecified depressive disorder is warranted.

Substance/Medication-Induced

Depressive Disorder

A.
A prominent and persistent disturbance in mood that predominates in the clinical picture and is characterized by depressedmoodormarkedlydiminishedinterestorpleasureinall, oralmost all, activities.

B.
There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of both (1) and (2): 

1. The symptoms in Criterion A developed during or soon aftersubstance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication.
2. The involved substance/medication is capable of producingthe symptoms in Criterion

A.

C.
The disturbance is not better explained by a depressive disorderthat is not substance/medication-induced. Such evidence of an independent depressive disorder could include the following:
Thesymptomsprecededtheonsetofthesubstance/medication use; the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of acute withdrawalorsevereintoxication; orthereisotherevidencesuggesting the existence of an independent non-substance/ medication-induceddepressivedisorder (e.g., ahistoryofrecurrent non-substance/medication-related episodes).

D.
The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course ofa delirium.

E.
The disturbance causes clinicallysignificant distress or impairmentinsocial, occupational, orotherimportantareasoffunctioning.

Note: This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substanceintoxicationorsubstancewithdrawalonlywhenthesymptoms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical picture and when they are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention.
Coding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medication]-induceddepressivedisordersareindicatedin the table below. Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the same class of substance. If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced depressive disorder, the 4 th position characteris“1, ”andtheclinicianshouldrecord“mild[substance]use disorder” before the substance-induced depressive disorder (e.g.,
“mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced depressive disorder”).Ifamoderateorseveresubstanceusedisorderiscomorbidwith the substance-induced depressive disorder, the 4 th position character is “2, ” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder, ” depending on the severityofthecomorbidsubstanceusedisorder.Ifthereisnocomorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), thenthe 4 thpositioncharacteris“9, ”andtheclinicianshould record only the substance-induced depressive disorder.

Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” designation include the following:
1. Recurrentbriefdepression: Concurrentpresenceofdepressedmood and at least four other symptoms of depression for 2–13 days at least once per month (not associated with the menstrual cycle) for at least 12 consecutive months in an individual whose presentation has never met criteria for any other depressive or bipolar disorder and does not currently meet active or residual criteria for any psychotic disorder.

Specifiers for Depressive Disorders

Specify if:
With anxious distress: Anxious distress is defined as the presenceofatleasttwoofthefollowingsymptomsduringthemajority of days of a major depressive episode or persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia):
1. Feeling keyed up or tense.

2. Feeling unusually restless.

3. Difficulty concentrating because of worry. 

4. Fear that something awful may happen.

5. Feeling that the individual might lose control of himself orherself.
Specify current severity:
Mild: Two symptoms.
Moderate: Three symptoms.
Moderate-severe: Four or five symptoms.
Severe: Four or five symptoms and with motor agitation.

Note: Anxiousdistresshasbeennotedasaprominentfeatureof both bipolar and major depressive disorder in both primary care and specialty mental health settings. High levels of anxiety have been associated with higher suicide risk, longer duration of illness, andgreaterlikelihoodoftreatmentnonresponse.Asaresult, itisclinicallyusefultospecifyaccuratelythepresenceandseverity levels of anxious distress for treatment planning and monitoring of response to treatment.
With mixed features:

A.
At least three of the following manic/hypomanic symptomsare present nearly every day during the majority of days of a major depressive episode:
1. Elevated, expansive mood.

2. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity.

3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking.

4. Flightofideasorsubjectiveexperiencethatthoughtsareracing.
5. Increase in energy or goal-directed activity (either socially, atworkorschool, orsexually).
6. Increased or excessive involvement in activities thathaveahighpotentialforpainfulconsequences (e.g., engaging in unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, foolish business investments).
7. Decreased need for sleep (feeling rested despite sleeping less than usual; to be contrasted with insomnia).

B.
Mixed symptoms are observable by others and represent achange from the person’s usual behavior.

C.
For individuals whose symptoms meet full criteria for eithermania or hypomania, the diagnosis should be bipolar I or bipolar II disorder.

D.
Themixedsymptomsarenotattributabletothephysiologicaleffectsofasubstance (e.g., adrugofabuse, amedicationor other treatment).

Note: Mixedfeaturesassociatedwithamajordepressiveepisode have been found to be a significant risk factor for the development of bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. As a result, it is clinically useful to note the presence of this specifier for treatment planning and monitoring of response to treatment.
With melancholic features:

A.
Oneofthefollowingispresentduringthemostsevereperiodof the current episode:
1. Loss of pleasure in all, or almost all, activities.

2. Lackofreactivitytousuallypleasurablestimuli (doesnotfeel much better, even temporarily, when something good happens).

B.
Three (or more) of the following: 

1. A distinct quality of depressed mood characterized byprofounddespondency, despair, and/ormorosenessorby so-called empty mood.
2. Depression that is regularly worse in the morning.

3. Early-morning awakening (i.e., at least 2 hours beforeusual awakening).
4. Marked psychomotor agitation or retardation.

5. Significant anorexia or weight loss.

6. Excessive or inappropriate guilt.

Note: Thespecifier“withmelancholicfeatures”isappliedifthese features are present at the most severe stage of the episode.
There is a near-complete absence of the capacity for pleasure, not merely a diminution. A guideline for evaluating the lack of reactivity of mood is that even highly desired events are not associatedwithmarkedbrighteningofmood.Eithermooddoesnot brighten at all, or it brightens only partially (e.g., up to 20%–40% of normal for only minutes at a time). The “distinct quality” of mood that is characteristic of the “with melancholic features” specifierisexperienced asqualitativelydifferentfromthat during a nonmelancholic depressive episode. A depressed mood that is described as merely more severe, longer lasting, or present without a reason is not considered distinct in quality. Psychomotor changesarenearlyalwayspresentand are observableby others.
Melancholicfeatures exhibit only a modest tendency to repeat across episodes in the same individual. They are more frequent in inpatients, as opposed to outpatients; are less likely to occur in milder than in more severe major depressive episodes; and are more likely to occur in those with psychotic features.
With atypical features: This specifier can be applied when these features predominate during the majority of days of the current or most recent major depressive episode or persistent depressive disorder.

A.
Moodreactivity (i.e., moodbrightensinresponsetoactualorpotential positive events).

B.
Two (or more) of the following: 

1. Significant weight gain or increase in appetite.

2. Hypersomnia.

3. Leaden paralysis (i.e., heavy, leaden feelings in arms orlegs).
4. A long-standing pattern of interpersonal rejection sensitivity (not limited to episodes of mood disturbance) thatresults in significant social or occupational impairment.

C.
Criteria are not met for “with melancholic features” or “withcatatonia” during the same episode.

Increased appetite may be manifested by an obvious increase in food intake or by weight gain. Hypersomnia may include either an extended period of nighttime sleep or daytime napping that totals at least 10 hours of sleep per day (or at least
2 hoursmorethanwhennotdepressed).Leadenparalysisisdefined as feeling heavy, leaden, or weighted down, usually in the arms or legs. This sensation is generally present for at least an hour a day but often lasts for many hours at a time. Unlike the otheratypicalfeatures, pathologicalsensitivitytoperceivedinterpersonal rejection is a trait that has an early onset and persists throughout most of adult life. Rejection sensitivity occurs both whenthepersonisandisnotdepressed, thoughitmaybeexacerbated during depressive periods.
With psychotic features: Delusions and/or hallucinations are present.
Withmood-congruentpsychoticfeatures: Thecontentof all delusions and hallucinations is consistent with the typical depressive themes of personal inadequacy, guilt, disease, death, nihilism, or deserved punishment.
Withmood-incongruentpsychoticfeatures: Thecontent of the delusions or hallucinations does not involve typical depressive themes of personal inadequacy, guilt, disease, death, nihilism, or deserved punishment, or the content is a mixture of mood-incongruent and mood-congruent themes.

With catatonia: The catatonia specifier can apply to an episode ofdepressionifcatatonicfeaturesarepresentduringmostofthe episode. See criteria for catatonia associated with a mental disorder in the chapter “Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders.”

Note: Moodepisodescanhavetheironseteitherduringpregnancy or postpartum. Although the estimates differ according to the period of follow-up after delivery, between 3% and 6% of women will experience the onset of a major depressive episode during pregnancy or in the weeks or months following delivery. Fifty percent of “postpartum” major depressive episodesactuallybeginpriortodelivery.Thus, theseepisodes are referred to collectively as peripartum episodes. Women with peripartum major depressive episodes often have severe anxiety and even panic attacks. Prospective studies have demonstrated that mood and anxiety symptoms during pregnancy, as well as the “baby blues, ” increase the risk for a postpartum major depressive episode.

Postpartum mood (major depressive or manic) episodes with psychotic features appear to occur in from 1 in 500 to
1 in 1, 000 deliveries and may be more common in primiparous women. The risk of postpartum episodes with psychotic features is particularly increased for women with prior postpartum mood episodes but is also elevated for those with a prior history of a depressive or bipolar disorder (especially bipolar I disorder) and those with a family history of bipolar disorders.
Once a woman has had a postpartum episode with psychotic features, the risk of recurrence with each subsequent delivery is between 30% and 50%.

A.
There has been a regular temporal relationship between theonset of major depressive episodes in major depressive disorderandaparticulartimeoftheyear (e.g., inthefallorwinter).

Note: Do not include cases in which there is an obvious effect of seasonally related psychosocial stressors (e.g., regularly being unemployed every winter).

B.
Fullremissions (orachangefrommajordepressiontomaniaor hypomania) also occur at a characteristic time of the year
(e.g., depression disappears in the spring).

C.
In the last 2 years, two major depressive episodes have occurredthatdemonstratethetemporalseasonalrelationshipsdefined above and no nonseasonal major depressive episodes have occurred during that same period.

D.
Seasonal major depressive episodes (as described above)substantially outnumber the nonseasonal major depressive episodes that may have occurred over the individual’s lifetime.

Note: The specifier “with seasonal pattern” can be applied to the pattern of major depressive episodes in major depressive disorder, recurrent. The essential feature is the onset and remission of major depressive episodes at characteristic times of the year. In mostcases, theepisodesbegininfallorwinterandremitinspring.

Specify if:
In partial remission: Symptoms of the immediately previous major depressive episode are present, but full criteria are not met, or there is a period lasting less than 2 months without any significantsymptomsofamajordepressiveepisodefollowingthe end of such an episode.
In full remission: During the past 2 months, no significant signs or symptoms of the disturbance were present.
Specify current severity:
Severity is based on the number of criterion symptoms, the severity of those symptoms, and the degree of functional disability.
Mild: Few, ifany, symptomsinexcessofthoserequiredtomake the diagnosis are present, the intensity of the symptoms is distressing but manageable, and the symptoms result in minor impairment in social or occupational functioning.
Moderate: The number of symptoms, intensity of symptoms, and/or functional impairment are between those specified for
“mild” and “severe.”
Severe: The number of symptoms is substantially in excess of that required to make the diagnosis, the intensity of the symptoms is seriously distressing and unmanageable, and the symptomsmarkedlyinterferewithsocialandoccupationalfunctioning.
