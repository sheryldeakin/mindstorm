### **Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder**
**296.99 (F34.8)**

*   **A. Severe recurrent temper outbursts** manifested verbally (e.g., verbal rages) and/or behaviorally (e.g., physical aggression toward people or property) that are **grossly out of proportion in intensity or duration** to the situation or provocation.
*   **B.** The temper outbursts are **inconsistent with developmental level**.
*   **C.** The temper outbursts occur, on average, **three or more times per week**.
*   **D.** The mood between temper outbursts is **persistently irritable or angry** most of the day, nearly every day, and is observable by others (e.g., parents, teachers, peers).
*   **E. Criteria A–D have been present for 12 or more months**. **Throughout that time, the individual has not had a period lasting 3 or more consecutive months without all of the symptoms in Criteria A–D**.
*   **F. Criteria A and D are present in at least two of three settings** (i.e., at home, at school, with peers) and are **severe in at least one of these**.
*   **G.** The diagnosis should not be made for the first time **before age 6 years or after age 18 years**.
*   **H.** By history or observation, the **age at onset of Criteria A–E is before 10 years**.
*   **I.** There has **never been a distinct period lasting more than 1 day** during which the full symptom criteria, except duration, for a manic or hypomanic episode have been met.
    *   **Note: Developmentally appropriate mood elevation**, such as occurs in the context of a highly positive event or its anticipation, should not be considered as a symptom of mania or hypomania.
*   **J.** The behaviors do not occur exclusively during an episode of major depressive disorder and are not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., autism spectrum disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, separation anxiety disorder, persistent depressive disorder [dysthymia]).
    *   **Note: This diagnosis cannot coexist with oppositional defiant disorder, intermittent explosive disorder, or bipolar disorder**, though it can coexist with others, including major depressive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and substance use disorders. **Individuals whose symptoms meet criteria for both disruptive mood dysregulation disorder and oppositional defiant disorder should only be given the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder**. **If an individual has ever experienced a manic or hypomanic episode, the diagnosis of disruptive mood dysregulation disorder should not be assigned**.
*   **K.** The symptoms are **not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance** or to another medical or neurological condition.

---

### **Major Depressive Disorder**

*   **A. Five (or more) of the following symptoms** have been present during the **same 2-week period** and represent a change from previous functioning; at least one of the symptoms is either **(1) depressed mood or (2) loss of interest or pleasure**.
    *   **Note: Do not include symptoms that are clearly attributable to another medical condition**.
    1.  **Depressed mood** most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report (e.g., feels sad, empty, hopeless) or observation made by others (e.g., appears tearful). (**Note: In children and adolescents, can be irritable mood**).
    2.  **Markedly diminished interest or pleasure** in all, or almost all, activities most of the day, nearly every day (as indicated by either subjective account or observation).
    3.  **Significant weight loss** when not dieting or weight gain (e.g., a change of more than 5% of body weight in a month), or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day. (**Note: In children, consider failure to make expected weight gain**).
    4.  **Insomnia or hypersomnia** nearly every day.
    5.  **Psychomotor agitation or retardation** nearly every day (observable by others, not merely subjective feelings of restlessness or being slowed down).
    6.  **Fatigue or loss of energy** nearly every day.
    7.  **Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt** (which may be delusional) nearly every day (not merely self-reproach or guilt about being sick).
    8.  **Diminished ability to think or concentrate**, or indecisiveness, nearly every day (either by subjective account or as observed by others).
    9.  **Recurrent thoughts of death** (not just fear of dying), recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.
*   **B.** The symptoms cause **clinically significant distress or impairment** in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
*   **C.** The episode is **not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance** or to another medical condition.
    *   **Note: Criteria A–C represent a major depressive episode**.
    *   **Note: Responses to a significant loss** (e.g., bereavement, financial ruin, losses from a natural disaster, a serious medical illness or disability) may include the feelings of intense sadness, rumination about the loss, insomnia, poor appetite, and weight loss noted in Criterion A, which may resemble a depressive episode. **Although such symptoms may be understandable or considered appropriate to the loss, the presence of a major depressive episode in addition to the normal response to a significant loss should also be carefully considered**. **This decision inevitably requires the exercise of clinical judgment based on the individual’s history and the cultural norms for the expression of distress in the context of loss**.**1**
*   **D.** The occurrence of the major depressive episode is **not better explained by schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorder, delusional disorder, or other specified and unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders**.
*   **E. There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode**.
    *   **Note: This exclusion does not apply if all of the manic-like or hypomanic-like episodes are substance-induced or are attributable to the physiological effects of another medical condition**.

#### **Footnote 1: Distinguishing Grief From a Major Depressive Episode (MDE)**
**In distinguishing grief from a major depressive episode (MDE), it is useful to consider that in grief the predominant affect is feelings of emptiness and loss, while in an MDE, it is persistent depressed mood and the inability to anticipate happiness or pleasure**. **The dysphoria in grief is likely to decrease in intensity over days to weeks and occurs in waves, the so-called pangs of grief**. **These waves tend to be associated with thoughts or reminders of the deceased**. **The depressed mood of an MDE is more persistent and not tied to specific thoughts or preoccupations**. **The pain of grief may be accompanied by positive emotions and humor that are uncharacteristic of the pervasive unhappiness and misery characteristic of an MDE**. **The thought content associated with grief generally features a preoccupation with thoughts and memories of the deceased, rather than the self-critical or pessimistic ruminations seen in an MDE**. **In grief, self-esteem is generally preserved, whereas in an MDE, feelings of worthlessness and self-loathing are common**. **If self-derogatory ideation is present in grief, it typically involves perceived failings vis-à-vis the deceased (e.g., not visiting frequently enough, not telling the deceased how much he or she was loved)**. **If a bereaved individual thinks about death and dying, such thoughts are generally focused on the deceased and possibly about “joining” the deceased, whereas in an MDE, such thoughts are focused on ending one’s own life because of feeling worthless, undeserving of life, or unable to cope with the pain of depression**.

#### **Coding and Recording Procedures**
The diagnostic code is based on whether this is a **single or recurrent episode, current severity, presence of psychotic features, and remission status**. **Current severity and psychotic features are only indicated if full criteria are currently met for a major depressive episode**. **Remission specifiers are only indicated if the full criteria are not currently met for a major depressive episode**. **Codes are as follows:**

| Severity/course specifier | Single episode | Recurrent episode* |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Mild (p. 114)** | 296.21 (F32.0) | 296.31 (F33.0) |
| **Moderate (p. 114)** | 296.22 (F32.1) | 296.32 (F33.1) |
| **Severe (p. 114)** | 296.23 (F32.2) | 296.33 (F33.2) |
| **With psychotic features\*\*** (p. 111) | 296.24 (F32.3) | 296.34 (F33.3) |
| **In partial remission (p. 114)** | 296.25 (F32.4) | 296.35 (F33.41) |
| **In full remission (p. 114)** | 296.26 (F32.5) | 296.36 (F33.42) |
| **Unspecified** | 296.20 (F32.9) | 296.30 (F33.9) |


*\*For an episode to be considered recurrent, there must be an interval of at least 2 consecutive months between separate episodes in which criteria are not met for a major depressive episode*. *\*\*If psychotic features are present, code the “with psychotic features” specifier irrespective of episode severity*.

**In recording the name of a diagnosis, terms should be listed in the following order: major depressive disorder, single or recurrent episode, severity/psychotic/remission specifiers, followed by as many of the following specifiers without codes that apply to the current episode**.

*   **Specify:**
    *   With anxious distress (pp. 107–108)
    *   With mixed features (pp. 108–109)
    *   With melancholic features (pp. 109–110)
    *   With atypical features (pp. 110–111)
    *   With mood-congruent psychotic features (p. 111)
    *   With mood-incongruent psychotic features (p. 111)
    *   With catatonia (p. 111). **Coding note: Use additional code 293.89 (F06.1)**.
    *   With peripartum onset (pp. 111–112)
    *   With seasonal pattern (recurrent episode only) (pp. 113–114)

### **Persistent Depressive Disorder (Dysthymia)**
**300.4 (F34.1)**

This disorder represents a consolidation of **DSM-IV-defined chronic major depressive disorder and dysthymic disorder**.
*   **A. Depressed mood for most of the day, for more days than not**, as indicated by either subjective account or observation by others, for **at least 2 years**.
    *   **Note: In children and adolescents, mood can be irritable and duration must be at least 1 year**.
*   **B. Presence, while depressed, of two (or more)** of the following:
    1.  Poor appetite or overeating.
    2.  Insomnia or hypersomnia.
    3.  Low energy or fatigue.
    4.  Low self-esteem.
    5.  Poor concentration or difficulty making decisions.
    6.  Feelings of hopelessness.
*   **C.** During the **2-year period** (1 year for children or adolescents) of the disturbance, the individual has **never been without the symptoms in Criteria A and B for more than 2 months at a time**.
*   **D. Criteria for a major depressive disorder may be continuously present for 2 years**.
*   **E. There has never been a manic episode or a hypomanic episode**, and criteria have never been met for cyclothymic disorder.
*   **F.** The disturbance is **not better explained by a persistent schizoaffective disorder, schizophrenia, delusional disorder**, or other specified or unspecified schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorder.
*   **G.** The symptoms are **not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance** (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) **or another medical condition** (e.g., hypothyroidism).
*   **H.** The symptoms cause **clinically significant distress or impairment** in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
    *   **Note: Because the criteria for a major depressive episode include four symptoms that are absent from the symptom list for persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia)**, a very limited number of individuals will have depressive symptoms that have persisted longer than 2 years but will not meet criteria for persistent depressive disorder. **If full criteria for a major depressive episode have been met at some point during the current episode of illness, they should be given a diagnosis of major depressive disorder**. **Otherwise, a diagnosis of other specified depressive disorder or unspecified depressive disorder is warranted**.

**Specify if:** 
* With anxious distress (pp. 107–108)
* With mixed features (pp. 108–109)
* With melancholic features (pp. 109–110)
* With atypical features (pp. 110–111)
* With mood-congruent psychotic features (p. 111)
* With mood-incongruent psychotic features (p. 111)
* With peripartum onset (pp. 111–112).

**Specify if:** 
* In partial remission (p. 114)
* In full remission (p. 114).
**Specify if:** 
* **Early onset:** If onset is before age 21 years. 
* **Late onset:** If onset is at age 21 years or older.

**Specify if (for most recent 2 years of persistent depressive disorder):** 
* **With pure dysthymic syndrome:** Full criteria for a major depressive episode have not been met in at least the preceding 2 years. 
* **With persistent major depressive episode:** Full criteria for a major depressive episode have been met throughout the preceding 2-year period. 
* **With intermittent major depressive episodes, with current episode:** Full criteria for a major depressive episode are currently met, but there have been periods of at least 8 weeks in at least the preceding 2 years with symptoms below the threshold for a full major depressive episode. 
* **With intermittent major depressive episodes, without current episode:** Full criteria for a major depressive episode are not currently met, but there has been one or more major depressive episodes in at least the preceding 2 years.

**Specify current severity:** 
* Mild (p. 114)
* Moderate (p. 114)
* Severe (p. 114).

### **Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder**
**625.4 (N94.3)**

*   **A.** In the **majority of menstrual cycles, at least five symptoms** must be present in the final week before the onset of menses, start to **improve within a few days after the onset of menses**, and become **minimal or absent in the week postmenses**.
*   **B. One (or more) of the following symptoms must be present:**
    1.  **Marked affective lability** (e.g., mood swings; feeling suddenly sad or tearful, or increased sensitivity to rejection).
    2.  **Marked irritability or anger** or increased interpersonal conflicts.
    3.  **Marked depressed mood, feelings of hopelessness, or self-deprecating thoughts**.
    4.  **Marked anxiety, tension, and/or feelings of being keyed up or on edge**.
*   **C. One (or more) of the following symptoms must additionally be present**, to reach a total of five symptoms when combined with symptoms from Criterion B:

    2.  Subjective difficulty in concentration.
    3.  Lethargy, easy fatigability, or marked lack of energy.
    4.  Marked change in appetite; overeating; or specific food cravings.
    5.  Hypersomnia or insomnia.
    6.  A sense of being overwhelmed or out of control.
    7.  Physical symptoms such as breast tenderness or swelling, joint or muscle pain, a sensation of “bloating,” or weight gain.
    *   **Note: The symptoms in Criteria A–C must have been met for most menstrual cycles that occurred in the preceding year**.
*   **D.** The symptoms are associated with **clinically significant distress or interference** with work, school, usual social activities, or relationships with others (e.g., avoidance of social activities; decreased productivity and efficiency at work, school, or home).
*   **E.** The disturbance is **not merely an exacerbation of the symptoms of another disorder**, such as major depressive disorder, panic disorder, persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), or a personality disorder (although it may co-occur with any of these disorders).
*   **F. Criterion A should be confirmed by prospective daily ratings during at least two symptomatic cycles**. (**Note: The diagnosis may be made provisionally prior to this confirmation**).
*   **G.** The symptoms are **not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance** (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication, other treatment) **or another medical condition** (e.g., hyperthyroidism).

**Recording Procedures: If symptoms have not been confirmed by prospective daily ratings of at least two symptomatic cycles, “provisional” should be noted after the name of the diagnosis (i.e., “premenstrual dysphoric disorder, provisional”)**.

---

### **Substance/Medication-Induced Depressive Disorder**

*   **A.** A **prominent and persistent disturbance in mood** that predominates in the clinical picture and is characterized by **depressed mood or markedly diminished interest or pleasure** in all, or almost all, activities.
*   **B.** There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings of both (1) and (2):
    1.  The symptoms in Criterion A developed **during or soon after substance intoxication or withdrawal or after exposure to a medication**.
    2.  The involved substance/medication is **capable of producing the symptoms** in Criterion A.
*   **C.** The disturbance is **not better explained by a depressive disorder that is not substance/medication-induced**. **Such evidence of an independent depressive disorder could include the following: The symptoms preceded the onset of the substance/medication use; the symptoms persist for a substantial period of time (e.g., about 1 month) after the cessation of acute withdrawal or severe intoxication; or there is other evidence suggesting the existence of an independent non-substance/medication-induced depressive disorder (e.g., a history of recurrent non-substance/medication-related episodes)**.
*   **D.** The disturbance **does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium**.
*   **E.** The disturbance causes **clinically significant distress or impairment** in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.
    *   **Note: This diagnosis should be made instead of a diagnosis of substance intoxication or substance withdrawal only when the symptoms in Criterion A predominate in the clinical picture and when they are sufficiently severe to warrant clinical attention**.

**Coding note: The ICD-9-CM and ICD-10-CM codes for the [specific substance/medication]-induced depressive disorders are indicated in the table below**. **Note that the ICD-10-CM code depends on whether or not there is a comorbid substance use disorder present for the same class of substance**. **If a mild substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced depressive disorder, the 4th position character is “1,” and the clinician should record “mild [substance] use disorder” before the substance-induced depressive disorder (e.g., “mild cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced depressive disorder”)**. **If a moderate or severe substance use disorder is comorbid with the substance-induced depressive disorder, the 4th position character is “2,” and the clinician should record “moderate [substance] use disorder” or “severe [substance] use disorder,” depending on the severity of the comorbid substance use disorder**. **If there is no comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), then the 4th position character is “9,” and the clinician should record only the substance-induced depressive disorder**.

| Substance | ICD-9-CM | ICD-10-CM: With mild use disorder | ICD-10-CM: With moderate or severe use disorder | ICD-10-CM: Without use disorder |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Alcohol** | 291.89 | F10.14 | F10.24 | F10.94 |
| **Phencyclidine** | 292.84 | F16.14 | F16.24 | F16.94 |
| **Other hallucinogen** | 292.84 | F16.14 | F16.24 | F16.94 |
| **Inhalant** | 292.84 | F18.14 | F18.24 | F18.94 |
| **Opioid** | 292.84 | F11.14 | F11.24 | F11.94 |
| **Sedative, hypnotic, or anxiolytic** | 292.84 | F13.14 | F13.24 | F13.94 |
| **Amphetamine (or other stimulant)** | 292.84 | F15.14 | F15.24 | F15.94 |
| **Cocaine** | 292.84 | F14.14 | F14.24 | F14.94 |
| **Other (or unknown) substance** | 292.84 | F19.14 | F19.24 | F19.94 |


**Specify if (see Table 1 in the chapter “Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders” for diagnoses associated with substance class):**
*   **With onset during intoxication:** If criteria are met for intoxication with the substance and the symptoms develop during intoxication.
*   **With onset during withdrawal:** If criteria are met for withdrawal from the substance and the symptoms develop during, or shortly after, withdrawal.

#### **Recording Procedures**
**ICD-9-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced depressive disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the depressive symptoms**. **The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class**. **For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category “unknown substance” should be used**. **The name of the disorder is followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal)**. **Unlike the recording procedures for ICD-10-CM, which combine the substance-induced disorder and substance use disorder into a single code, for ICD-9-CM a separate diagnostic code is given for the substance use disorder**. **For example, in the case of depressive symptoms occurring during withdrawal in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is 292.84 cocaine-induced depressive disorder, with onset during withdrawal**. **An additional diagnosis of 304.20 severe cocaine use disorder is also given**. **When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of depressive mood symptoms, each should be listed separately (e.g., 292.84 methylphenidate-induced depressive disorder, with onset during withdrawal; 292.84 dexamethasone-induced depressive disorder, with onset during intoxication)**.

**ICD-10-CM. The name of the substance/medication-induced depressive disorder begins with the specific substance (e.g., cocaine, dexamethasone) that is presumed to be causing the depressive symptoms**. **The diagnostic code is selected from the table included in the criteria set, which is based on the drug class and presence or absence of a comorbid substance use disorder**. **For substances that do not fit into any of the classes (e.g., dexamethasone), the code for “other substance” should be used; and in cases in which a substance is judged to be an etiological factor but the specific class of substance is unknown, the category “unknown substance” should be used**. **When recording the name of the disorder, the comorbid substance use disorder (if any) is listed first, followed by the word “with,” followed by the name of the substance-induced depressive disorder, followed by the specification of onset (i.e., onset during intoxication, onset during withdrawal)**. **For example, in the case of depressive symptoms occurring during withdrawal in a man with a severe cocaine use disorder, the diagnosis is F14.24 severe cocaine use disorder with cocaine-induced depressive disorder, with onset during withdrawal**. **A separate diagnosis of the comorbid severe cocaine use disorder is not given**. **If the substance-induced depressive disorder occurs without a comorbid substance use disorder (e.g., after a one-time heavy use of the substance), no accompanying substance use disorder is noted (e.g., F16.94 phencyclidine-induced depressive disorder, with onset during intoxication)**. **When more than one substance is judged to play a significant role in the development of depressive mood symptoms, each should be listed separately (e.g., F15.24 severe methylphenidate use disorder with methylphenidate-induced depressive disorder, with onset during withdrawal; F19.94 dexamethasone-induced depressive disorder, with onset during intoxication)**.

### **Depressive Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition**

*   **A. A prominent and persistent period of depressed mood or markedly diminished interest or pleasure** in all, or almost all, activities that predominates in the clinical picture.
*   **B.** There is evidence from the history, physical examination, or laboratory findings that the **disturbance is the direct pathophysiological consequence of another medical condition**.
*   **C.** The disturbance is **not better explained by another mental disorder** (e.g., adjustment disorder, with depressed mood, in which the stressor is a serious medical condition).
*   **D. The disturbance does not occur exclusively during the course of a delirium**.
*   **E. The disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment** in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

**Coding note: The ICD-9-CM code for depressive disorder due to another medical condition is 293.83, which is assigned regardless of the specifier**. **The ICD-10-CM code depends on the specifier (see below):**
*   **(F06.31) With depressive features:** Full criteria are not met for a major depressive episode.
*   **(F06.32) With major depressive–like episode:** Full criteria are met (except Criterion C) for a major depressive episode.
*   **(F06.34) With mixed features:** Symptoms of mania or hypomania are also present but do not predominate in the clinical picture.

**Coding note: Include the name of the other medical condition in the name of the mental disorder (e.g., 293.83 [F06.31] depressive disorder due to hypothyroidism, with depressive features)**. **The other medical condition should also be coded and listed separately immediately before the depressive disorder due to the medical condition (e.g., 244.9 [E03.9] hypothyroidism; 293.83 [F06.31] depressive disorder due to hypothyroidism, with depressive features)**.

---

### **Other Specified Depressive Disorder**
**311 (F32.8)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a depressive disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the depressive disorders diagnostic class. **The other specified depressive disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses to communicate the specific reason that the presentation does not meet the criteria for any specific depressive disorder**. **This is done by recording “other specified depressive disorder” followed by the specific reason (e.g., “short-duration depressive episode”)**.

**Examples of presentations that can be specified using the “other specified” designation include the following:**
1.  **Recurrent brief depression:** Concurrent presence of depressed mood and at least four other symptoms of depression for **2–13 days at least once per month** (not associated with the menstrual cycle) for at least 12 consecutive months in an individual whose presentation has never met criteria for any other depressive or bipolar disorder and does not currently meet active or residual criteria for any psychotic disorder.
2.  **Short-duration depressive episode (4–13 days):** Depressed affect and at least four of the other eight symptoms of a major depressive episode associated with clinically significant distress or impairment that persist for more than 4 days, but less than 14 days, in an individual whose presentation has never met criteria for any other depressive or bipolar disorder, does not currently meet active or residual criteria for any psychotic disorder, and does not meet criteria for recurrent brief depression.
3.  **Depressive episode with insufficient symptoms:** Depressed affect and at least one of the other eight symptoms of a major depressive episode associated with clinically significant distress or impairment that persist for at least 2 weeks in an individual whose presentation has never met criteria for any other depressive or bipolar disorder, does not currently meet active or residual criteria for any psychotic disorder, and does not meet criteria for mixed anxiety and depressive disorder symptoms.

---

### **Unspecified Depressive Disorder**
**311 (F32.9)**

This category applies to presentations in which symptoms characteristic of a depressive disorder that cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning predominate but do not meet the full criteria for any of the disorders in the depressive disorders diagnostic class. **The unspecified depressive disorder category is used in situations in which the clinician chooses not to specify the reason that the criteria are not met for a specific depressive disorder, and includes presentations for which there is insufficient information to make a more specific diagnosis (e.g., in emergency room settings)**.

---

### **Specifiers for Depressive Disorders**

*   **With anxious distress:** Anxious distress is defined as the presence of **at least two of the following symptoms** during the majority of days of a major depressive episode or persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia):
    1.  Feeling keyed up or tense.
    2.  Feeling unusually restless.
    3.  Difficulty concentrating because of worry.
    4.  Fear that something awful may happen.
    5.  Feeling that the individual might lose control of himself or herself.
    *   **Specify current severity:** Mild: Two symptoms; Moderate: Three symptoms; Moderate-severe: Four or five symptoms; Severe: Four or five symptoms and with motor agitation.
    *   **Note: Anxious distress has been noted as a prominent feature of both bipolar and major depressive disorder... High levels of anxiety have been associated with higher suicide risk, longer duration of illness, and greater likelihood of treatment nonresponse**.

*   **With mixed features:**
    *   **A. At least three of the following manic/hypomanic symptoms** are present nearly every day during the majority of days of a major depressive episode:
        1. Elevated, expansive mood; 2. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity; 3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking; 4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing; 5. Increase in energy or goal-directed activity (either socially, at work or school, or sexually); 6. Increased or excessive involvement in activities that have a high potential for painful consequences; 7. Decreased need for sleep (feeling rested despite sleeping less than usual; to be contrasted with insomnia).
    *   **B.** Mixed symptoms are observable by others and represent a change from the person’s usual behavior.
    *   **C. For individuals whose symptoms meet full criteria for either mania or hypomania, the diagnosis should be bipolar I or bipolar II disorder**.
    *   **D.** The mixed symptoms are not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance.
    *   **Note: Mixed features associated with a major depressive episode have been found to be a significant risk factor for the development of bipolar I or bipolar II disorder**.

*   **With melancholic features:**
    *   **A.** One of the following is present during the most severe period of the current episode: 1. **Loss of pleasure** in all, or almost all, activities; 2. **Lack of reactivity** to usually pleasurable stimuli (does not feel much better, even temporarily, when something good happens).
    *   **B. Three (or more) of the following:** 1. A **distinct quality of depressed mood** (profound despondency/moroseness); 2. Depression regularly **worse in the morning**; 3. **Early-morning awakening** (at least 2 hours before usual awakening); 4. Marked psychomotor agitation or retardation; 5. Significant anorexia or weight loss; 6. Excessive or inappropriate guilt.
    *   **Note: There is a near-complete absence of the capacity for pleasure, not merely a diminution**. **Even highly desired events are not associated with marked brightening of mood**.

*   **With atypical features:** This specifier can be applied when these features predominate during the majority of days of the current or most recent major depressive episode or persistent depressive disorder.
    *   **A. Mood reactivity** (i.e., mood brightens in response to actual or potential positive events).
    *   **B. Two (or more) of the following:** 1. Significant weight gain or increase in appetite; 2. **Hypersomnia**; 3. **Leaden paralysis** (i.e., heavy, leaden feelings in arms or legs); 4. A long-standing pattern of **interpersonal rejection sensitivity**.
    *   **C.** Criteria are not met for “with melancholic features” or “with catatonia” during the same episode.
    *   **Note: “Atypical depression” has historical significance... and today does not connote an uncommon or unusual clinical presentation as the term might imply**.

*   **With psychotic features:** Delusions and/or hallucinations are present.
    *   **With mood-congruent psychotic features:** The content of all delusions and hallucinations is **consistent with the typical depressive themes** of personal inadequacy, guilt, disease, death, nihilism, or deserved punishment.
    *   **With mood-incongruent psychotic features:** The content of the delusions or hallucinations does not involve typical depressive themes... or the content is a mixture of mood-incongruent and mood-congruent themes.

*   **With catatonia:** The catatonia specifier can apply to an episode of depression if catatonic features are present during most of the episode. **See criteria for catatonia associated with a mental disorder in the chapter “Schizophrenia Spectrum and Other Psychotic Disorders”**.

*   **With peripartum onset:** This specifier can be applied to the current or, if full criteria are not currently met for a mood episode, most recent episode of major depression if onset of mood symptoms occurs **during pregnancy or in the 4 weeks following delivery**.
    *   **Note: Fifty percent of “postpartum” major depressive episodes actually begin prior to delivery. Thus, these episodes are referred to collectively as peripartum episodes**. **Women with peripartum major depressive episodes often have severe anxiety and even panic attacks**. **The risk of recurrence with each subsequent delivery is between 30% and 50%**.

*   **With seasonal pattern:** This specifier applies to recurrent major depressive disorder.
    *   **A.** There has been a **regular temporal relationship** between the onset of major depressive episodes in major depressive disorder and a particular time of the year (e.g., in the fall or winter). **Note: Do not include cases in which there is an obvious effect of seasonally related psychosocial stressors**.
    *   **B. Full remissions (or a change from major depression to mania or hypomania) also occur at a characteristic time of the year** (e.g., depression disappears in the spring).
    *   **C. In the last 2 years, two major depressive episodes have occurred that demonstrate the temporal seasonal relationships defined above and no nonseasonal major depressive episodes have occurred during that same period**.
    *   **D. Seasonal major depressive episodes (as described above) substantially outnumber the nonseasonal major depressive episodes that may have occurred over the individual’s lifetime**.
    *   **Note: The pattern of onset and remission of episodes must have occurred during at least a 2-year period, without any nonseasonal episodes occurring during this period**. **Major depressive episodes that occur in a seasonal pattern are often characterized by loss of energy, hypersomnia, overeating, weight gain, and a craving for carbohydrates**.

*   **Remission Specifiers:**
    *   **In partial remission:** Symptoms of the immediately previous major depressive episode are present, but full criteria are not met, or there is a period lasting less than 2 months without any significant symptoms of a major depressive episode following the end of such an episode.
    *   **In full remission:** During the past 2 months, no significant signs or symptoms of the disturbance were present.

*   **Severity Specifiers:** Severity is based on the number of criterion symptoms, the severity of those symptoms, and the degree of functional disability.
    *   **Mild:** Few, if any, symptoms in excess of those required to make the diagnosis are present, the intensity of the symptoms is distressing but manageable, and the symptoms result in minor impairment in social or occupational functioning.
    *   **Moderate:** The number of symptoms, intensity of symptoms, and/or functional impairment are between those specified for “mild” and “severe”.
    *   **Severe:** The number of symptoms is substantially in excess of that required to make the diagnosis, the intensity of the symptoms is **seriously distressing and unmanageable**, and the symptoms **markedly interfere with social and occupational functioning**.
